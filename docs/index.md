# Overview

Xpipes is a Jupyterlab-based extension that enables visual, low-code, training workflows. It is created by data scientists for data scientists. 


## Key Features

- Visual Low Code Workflow
- Code Generation (CodeGen)
- Customizable Components
- Debugger

# Workflow
1. Create a new Xpipes from the Jupyterlab launcher or open an existing .xpipes file.
2. Drag components from the Xpipes Component Tray to form your training workflow and link all triangles.
3. Press Compile button! The Xpipes will compile the components into a working python code.
4. Run the compiled python code using your own terminal or use our Output Viewer. 
5. Unexpected output? Would like to have more in-depth insights of the data between components? Mark the components you'd like to observe and try out our debugger.
